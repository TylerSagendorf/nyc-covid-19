My team fit separate ARIMA models to the daily number of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in NYC from March 3 to April 20. Then, we used these models to predict the behavior of each time series from April 21 to May 5. By comparing our predictions to the true values for that time period, we discovered that we were able to make predictions with a moderate to high degree of accuracy.

The final report is provided as a .pdf file, and the code used to generate the pdf is provided as a .Rmd file.
